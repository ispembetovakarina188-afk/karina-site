<h1 class="Interview-title"> Interview with Saylybaeva Botagoz Nazarbekovna</h1>
<p class="work-desc">I interviewed an English teacher to learn more about how group work is used in English lessons. I asked five questions related to this topic.</p>


<div class="work-gallery">

<div class="placeholder-img">
<h4 class="work2-title"> How often do you use group work in your lessons? </h4>
<p class="work2-text"> I use group work at least once a week in English lessons. For example, when we practice speaking activities or prepare small projects. It gives students more opportunities to talk and use the language.

<div class="placeholder-img">
    <h4 class="work2-title"> What types of tasks are most effective for group work? </h4>
    <p class="work2-text">Speaking tasks work best, such as discussions, role-plays, and debates. Group projects like creating posters, dialogues, or presentations are also very effective. These activities help students to practice vocabulary and grammar in real situations.

<div class="placeholder-img">
    <h4 class="work2-title">What challenges do you face when organizing group activities?
 </h4>
 <p class="work2-text">Sometimes stronger students dominate the conversation, while weaker students remain quiet. Another challenge is that students may switch to their native language instead of practicing English. Time management is also important.
 </p>

<div class="work-gallery">
<div class="placeholder-img">
    <h4 class="work2-title">How do you make sure every student participates actively?
 </h4>
 <p class="work2-text">I give each student a specific role, for example, leader, timekeeper, writer, or presenter. I also encourage quieter students to speak by asking direct questions. During activities, I walk around the classroom and listen to make sure everyone is practicing English.
 </p>

<div class="work-gallery">
<div class="placeholder-img  ">
    <h4 class="work2-title">How does group work influence students’ learning outcomes?
 </h4>
 <p class="work2-text"> Group work increases students’ speaking confidence. They learn to use English in real communication, not just in exercises. It also develops teamwork, improves listening skills, and helps them to remember new words and grammar structures better.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<h5 class="Interview-conclusion"> Conclusion </h5>
<p class="conclusion-text">Group work in English lessons is an effective method that helps students practice the language through real communication. It gives every learner a chance to speak, share ideas, and collaborate with peers. Despite some challenges, such as unequal participation or the use of the native language, group work develops speaking confidence, teamwork skills, and a better understanding of vocabulary and grammar. Therefore, group activities play an important role in improving students’ learning outcomes in English.
