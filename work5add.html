<h1 class="essay-title"> Test 1</h1>
<p class="essay-text"> It’s a 10-question online quiz designed to help you discover your personal leadership style.
The test is meant for a broad audience — not only business managers, but also teachers, trainers, and anyone who leads or guides others.
It’s based on several common leadership styles (such as democratic, autocratic, laissez-faire, and transformational) and helps you understand which one best fits your personality and approach.
At the end, you receive your dominant leadership type along with practical tips on how to build on your strengths and improve weaker areas.
