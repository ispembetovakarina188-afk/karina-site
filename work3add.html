    <h1 class="gifted-title">Analysis of results </h1>
    <p class="gifted-text">The survey, conducted among 11 respondents aged 18–21, provides valuable insights into perceptions of inclusive education, its challenges, and necessary improvements. The results show that understanding of the term “inclusive education” varies: while 54.5% correctly associate it with joint education of all children regardless of differences, 45.5% still believe it refers to separate education in specialized schools. This indicates a partial but not yet fully accurate awareness of the concept.</p>
<p class="gifted-text">Most respondents (54.5%) agree that inclusive education is necessary, although many recognize existing challenges. The main obstacles identified include negative public attitudes (72.7%) and the unpreparedness of teachers (63.6%), followed by the lack of qualified specialists (36.4%) and insufficient funding (18.2%). These findings highlight the gap between the idea of inclusion and real practical conditions in schools.</p>  
<p class="gifted-text">Teacher readiness is seen as insufficient: more than half of the respondents (54.5%) believe teachers are not adequately prepared to work in inclusive classrooms, while only 9.1% think they are fully prepared. Open-ended answers further emphasize the need for improved teacher training, accessible learning materials, supportive school culture, and adequate technological resources.</p>
<p class="gifted-text">Regarding personal experience, 45.5% have limited exposure to inclusive education, while 18.2% report significant experience. The main goal of inclusion, according to respondents, is ensuring equal learning opportunities and meaningful participation for all students.</p>
<p class="gifted-text">A large majority (63.6%) believe schools should fully adapt their environment to meet special educational needs. Respondents also identify specialists, teacher assistants, adapted materials, and professional development as the most crucial forms of support.</p>
<p class="gifted-text">Finally, public awareness remains low: 63.6% think most people are unfamiliar with inclusive education, indicating a significant need for community awareness campaigns.</p>
<p class="gifted-text">Overall, the survey suggests that while students support inclusive education, substantial improvements in teacher training, resources, and public understanding are necessary for its effective implementation.
