<h1> Group work</h1>
<p class="work-desc">Group work is a form of learning in which students work together on a common task, dividing roles and helping each other. The goal is to learn to interact effectively, develop communication skills, and solve more complex problems together, which leads to better retention of material and creates a positive classroom environment. </p>
